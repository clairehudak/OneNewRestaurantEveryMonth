# One New Restaurant Every Month

This is my Project 7: Neighborhood Map (React). The goal of this project was to create a single page application that featured an interactive map of a Neighborhood of my choice. See the full [requirements](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1351/view) for more details.  

## Inspiration For This Project
I live in North Dallas where there are countless restaurants to try. In fact, Addison, TX has more restaurants per capita than any other city in the U.S., so at the beginning of this year I decided to try one new restaurant every month (ONREM), and I thought this would be fun to showcase through my project.

## Installation/Launch
* Download the project
* Install all project dependencies with npm install
